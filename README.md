* [Memorize App](https://chogydan.github.io/demo/index.html)  This is an app written in Ionic 2 / Angular 2.  I started the project with the intent of learning Ionic 2 while also coding something useful for myself.  The day that Ionic 2 was actually released, where Ionic 3 was simultaneously announced, I felt like Ionic 2 was being deprecated.  How shocking!  I'm unsure if what I learned, or continue to learn, will stay relevant.  I'll revist Ionic when it becomes clearer how to stay up to date.  Ionic still works for the project, so I will continue with it.  It provides a lot of functionality out-of-the-box that really makes it easy to work with.
