* [Memorize App Demo](https://chogydan.github.io/demo/index.html)  
An app written in Ionic 2 / Angular 2.  I started the project with the intent of learning Ionic 2 while also coding something useful for myself.  On the day that Ionic 2 was actually released, Ionic 3's development and Ionic 2's phasing out was announced.  How shocking!  Ionic 2 was supposed to be a major overhall compared to Ionic 1, which I expected would have some staying power.
